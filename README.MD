# ðŸ”¥ YOLO v11 Fire and Smoke Detector

## Project Overview

This project implements a real-time fire and smoke detection system using YOLOv11 (You Only Look Once) object detection architecture. The model is trained on a custom dataset of fire and smoke images to provide accurate detection for safety monitoring applications.

## Model Training

The model was trained using [Ultralytics YOLOv11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), a state-of-the-art object detection framework. The training process involved:

1. Dataset preparation with fire and smoke annotations
2. Model initialization with pre-trained weights
3. Training with optimized hyperparameters
4. Model validation and performance evaluation

Key training parameters:

- Architecture: YOLOv11
- Image size: 640Ã—640
- Batch size: 8
- Training epochs: 100
- Early stopping patience: 20

The trained model has been exported to multiple formats:

- PyTorch (.pt) - Native format
- ONNX (.onnx) - Cross-platform deployment
- TensorFlow.js - Web browser deployment

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The core requirements include:

- ultralytics
- streamlit
- opencv-python
- torch
- pillow
- matplotlib

## Usage

### Model Training

To train or fine-tune the model:

```bash
jupyter notebook training.ipynb
```

The notebook contains step-by-step instructions for training, validation, and exporting the model.

### Detection Application

Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application provides three main functionalities:

- **Image Detection**: Upload and analyze static images
- **Video Detection**: Process pre-recorded videos
- **Webcam Detection**: Real-time detection using your webcam

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy in detecting fire and smoke in various conditions. Performance metrics include:

- mAP (mean Average Precision)
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

Visualization of these metrics can be found in `models/fire_smoke_detector/results.png`.

## Future Improvements

- Integration with alarm systems
- Deployment on edge devices
- Adding smoke density estimation
- Mobile application development
- Web application using TensorFlow.js
